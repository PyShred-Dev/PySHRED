# Introduction to PySHRED

## What is PySHRED?

PySHRED is a Python package implementing the SHallow REcurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture for sensing applications. PySHRED achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on full-state reconstructions and forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics from very few sensors.

The three core models in PySHRED are the sequence, decoder, and latent forecaster models.
- Sequence model: learns a low-dimensional latent representation of temporal sensor measurements.
- Decoder model: learns a mapping from the latent representation to the high-dimensional state space.
- Latent forecaster model: learns the latent dynamics and forecasts future latent states

The sequence and decoder models work together to reconstruct the high-dimensional state space from temporal sensor measurements. The latent forecaster and decoder models work together to forecast future high-dimensional states without requiring additional sensor measurements.

PySHRED achieves amazing performance on most applications right out-of-the-box. If you want to build your own SHRED model optimized for your application, PySHRED allows you to seamlessly mix-and-match different built-in sequence, decoder, and latent forecaster models. Furthermore, you can customize any of the built-in models to better suite your application.

**Figure:** The SHRED architecture consists of a sequence model that encodes temporal sensor dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space, and a decoder that reconstructs the full-state space from that latent representation. Additionally, SHRED leverages a latent forecaster model to predict the future evolution of the latent space, which is decoded to reconstruct the future full-state spatiotemporal dynamics.

## When to use PySHRED?

PySHRED is a powerful tool for any application involving the reconstruction/forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics from sensors measurements.

**Reconstruction:** Inferring the full-state dynamics of a system from sensor measurements.

**Forecasting:** Predicting future full-state dynamics of a system without using additional sensor measurements.

**Note:** SHRED is a supervised learning model, and training SHRED requires access to full-state data.
